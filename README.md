[Infinite Go](http://infinite-go.com) is a variant of the board game [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) which supports any number of simultaneous players on an infinite board. Because the game never ends, players cannot win or lose; instead, they aim to continually develop and secure regional territories by battling one another.
